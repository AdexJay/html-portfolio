 <h2>My Top 6 Movies of All-Time</h2>

 <hr />

 <p>Kindly note that these movies weren't particularly ranked in any other, but they are just movies that I enjoyed growing up. It's a mix of Christian movies and K-drama. Journey with me as we check out my favorite movies of all-time together.</p>

 <h2>Mi o le sé</h2>
 <p>This is a classic Mount Zion film that explores themes of human limitation and divine sufficiency. Mi o le sé (Yoruba for “I Cannot Do It”) follows a believer who reaches the end of their human strength and discovers that only total surrender to God’s help can bring true victory. Though the production is modest, its honest storytelling and relatable struggles make it impactful for audiences who appreciate faith-based, local-language dramas.</p>

 <h2>One Careless Night</h2>
 <p>This is a cautionary tale centered on how a single reckless decision can ruin years of a godly walk. It tackles moral choices, hidden sin, and restoration, showing the ripple effects of that “one careless night.” The film’s strength lies in its heartfelt performances and the typical Mount Zion style — simple but spiritually convicting. It’s ideal for youth fellowships and anyone needing a reminder that choices have consequences.</p>

 <h2>Forgotten Ones</h2>
 <p>A touching Christian drama that explores the plight of people abandoned or neglected by family and society. It highlights how God never forgets His own, no matter how hidden or forsaken they feel. Like many Mount Zion projects, the plot emphasizes prayer, redemption, and forgiveness, with a strong message about the power of the church to embrace the rejected.</p>

 <h2>Broken Pitcher</h2>
 <p>A metaphorical title that portrays a life or vessel once broken by sin but restored by God’s grace. This one is known for its deeper symbolic storytelling, calling believers to live pure lives as vessels for the Master’s use. It’s a convicting watch for personal reflection or Bible study groups, reminding us that no broken life is beyond divine repair.</p>

 <h2>Vincenzo</h2>
 <p>Vincenzo is a 2021 K-drama series. A slick, darkly comedic Korean series starring Song Joong-ki as a Korean-Italian mafia consigliere who returns to Korea to recover hidden gold but ends up fighting corporate corruption instead. Vincenzo is beloved for its stylish direction, eccentric characters, and clever mix of crime, law, and slapstick humor. Expect sharp dialogue, unpredictable twists, and a balance of heavy moments with over-the-top antics — a great pick if you enjoy K-dramas with anti-heroes.</p>

 <h2>Penthouse</h2>
 <p>An outrageous, addictive Korean makjang drama about ambition, revenge, and betrayal among Korea’s ultra-rich elite living in Hera Palace. The show is packed with shocking plot twists, catfights, and morally gray characters. Though melodramatic, it grips you with its cliffhangers and intense performances. If you like high drama, secret affairs, and power struggles, Penthouse is a wild ride — just don’t expect realism!</p>
